## Notes

This is a tip calculator app; I had actually made an app very similar to this a few years ago watching tutorials of a YouTuber named Rahul Pandey., who is also a great android developer, I decided to recreate this app but this time without watching any videos or taking any references online, overall I had a lot of fun making this app.
